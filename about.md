This blog will support Gentoo n00bs and pro users, that is, it will have basic and advanced tips. For you that have some difficulty configuring the [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org/) system, espero que seja Ãºtil. I hope it is useful. 

The blog has a very suggestive url subdomain name: [Terroo](https://terroo.github.io) that is the junction of [Terminal Root](http://terminalroot.com.br/) (my professional site, founded in 2011) with [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org/) , thus giving a conjuncture that maybe, later, it will be a project to build a [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux). 


I also have a [user](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Marcos.oliveira) on the [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org/) [Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Main_Page), to contribute documentation and translation.

## I hope you like this blog!
