<p>One of the things that linusers enjoy most is to customize their environment in their own way. Among resources, tools and possibilities, one of the resources that most stiffen the environment are the Conkys which are widgets that are highlighted on your desktop displaying some information from your system and have various styles. And I have separated 15 models for you.</p>

But those who want to see a full day view of the calendar will love this Conky. It was a personal project from the developer to his friend.

<h1 id="12-sci-fi-hud">12. <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1197920/">Sci-Fi HUD</a></h1>
<p>This Conky for Linux theme resembles an aircraftâ€™s Heads Up Display or HUD. The visual elements have a futuristic appearance painted on them. Perhaps these aspects have led the developer to name it so. Anyway, the theme has a little complexity in the user interface. But the general configuration is very polished. Thatâ€™s why it has become one of the most beautiful themes available for configuring your Conky.</p>

<h1 id="13-minimalis-conky">13. <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1112273/">Minimalis Conky</a></h1>
<p>This is an elegant-looking Conky. I thought it was not possible to find a Conky theme that was minimalist and beautiful at the same time. But this Conky proved that I was completely wrong. Many of you, including me, want this type of Conky, which does not take up much space on the desktop, instead of showing all the useful parameters in easily readable text.</p>

<h1 id="14-equalizer-conky">14. <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1112402/">Equalizer Conky</a></h1>
<p>Do not get confused with the name. Because this theme will not display the equalizer on your media player or allow you to adjust the ups and downs of the music that is playing. Instead, it will display common system status parameters with a few vertical bars that look exactly like an equalizer view.</p>

<h1 id="15-infinity-dark">15. <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1006547/">Infinity Dark</a></h1>
<p>Infinity Dark is a beautiful Conky that prioritizes the time and date. The developer included the Monofur font face with this theme, which makes the date and time even more vibrant. This theme uses the Entypo icon set to view disk usage, network activity, etc. It also shows CPU load, RAM usage and system uptime.</p>
