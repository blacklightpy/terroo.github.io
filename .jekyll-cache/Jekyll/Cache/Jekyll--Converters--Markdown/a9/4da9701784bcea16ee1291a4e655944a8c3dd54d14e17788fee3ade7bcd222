<p>Haiku OS, formerly known as OpenBeOS, is an open source operating system written in <a href="https://en.terminalroot.com.br/learn-to-create-a-graphical-application-with-c-and-gtkmm/">C++</a> that provides an object-oriented API.</p>

<p>Its development started in 2001 and became self-hosting in 2008. The first alpha version was made in September 2009, and the first most recent beta version in September 2018; development remains active in 2018, with “nightly images”.</p>

<p>Haiku is supported by Haiku, Inc., a nonprofit organization under siege in Rochester, New York, USA, founded in 2003 by former project leader Michel Phipps.</p>

<p>The name “Haiku” was chosen for the project in order to avoid misuse of a trademark now owned by Palm and aims to reflect the elegance and simplicity that attracted several users, in addition to being a direct reference to the error messages displayed in the Japanese haiku poetic form by the NetPositive browser and other Be programs.</p>

<p>The modular construction that teams of volunteer programmers independently work on replacing servers and APIs (known in Haiku as “kits”). Teams include:</p>

  <li>App/Interface - which includes interface kits, applications and support;</li>
  <li>BFS - Be File System), almost complete task, with the OpenBFS system used not only by Haiku but also by SkyOS;</li>
  <li>Game - which develops the kit for games and their APIs;</li>
  <li>Input Server - the server that manages input devices such as keyboards, mice and how they communicate with other parts of the system;</li>
  <li>Kernel - the core of the operating system;</li>
  <li>Media - developing the audio server and related APIs;</li>
  <li>Network, OpenGL, Translation and other teams.</li>
</ul>
