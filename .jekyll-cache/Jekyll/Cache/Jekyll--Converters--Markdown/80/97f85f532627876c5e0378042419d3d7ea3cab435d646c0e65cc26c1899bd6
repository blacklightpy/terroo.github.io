<p>Tiled window manager is a window manager with an organization of the screen in frames that do not overlap, as opposed to the most popular approach of stacking based on coordinates of overlapping objects that tries to fully emulate the desktop metaphor.</p>

<p>They consume much less system resources when compared to Graphical Interfaces, such as: KDE, GNOME, XFCE and others.</p>

<p>In this article we go to the top 25 and 2 more bonus tips at the end!</p>

<h1 id="01-bspwm">01. <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">bspwm</a></h1>
<p>bspwm represents windows as the leaves of a complete binary tree. It responds only to X events and messages it receives in a dedicated socket.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">bspc</code> is a program that writes messages to the bspwm socket. bspwm does not handle any keyboard or pointer input: a third party program (for example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">sxhkd</code>) is required to translate keyboard and pointer events into bspc invocations.</p>
