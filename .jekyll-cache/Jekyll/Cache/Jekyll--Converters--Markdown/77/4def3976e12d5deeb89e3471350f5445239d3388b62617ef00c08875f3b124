<p><img src="/assets/img/shell/shell.jpg" alt="Top 13 Shell Ranking for Your Linux or Unix" /></p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a long time since people asked me for this list (mainly as a ranking). Of course the choice will depend on your taste, but it is interesting to know the list so that it is easier for you.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>One of the reasons that most attributed the success of <a href="https://terminalroot.com.br/2016/11/blog-linux-unix.html">Unix</a> and <a href="https://terminalroot.com.br/linux">Linux</a>, sure was <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Shell">Shell</a>. A ‚Äúblessed‚Äù place that generates many facilities especially when we learn how to create scripts that do, configure everything for us with a simple command.</p>

<p>And with each passing day using commands becomes more useful. Almost all the news that comes up, only works in Shell, the command line. Success ended up ‚Äúspilling over‚Äù to <a href="https://terminalroot.com.br/2018/03/how-using-o-shell-bash-no-windows.html">Windows</a> which until then had only CMD, but soon found a way to port the most famous shell in the world Linux.</p>

<p>And not to mention that they still developed a shell of their own, although the features have not made users of: UNIX, <a href="https://terminalroot.com.br/2016/05/characteristicas-de-freebsd-openbsd- e-netbsd.html">BSD</a>, Linux to adopt them, for the sake of familiarity (mixing uppercase and lowercase letters, for example), something that makes it more confusing to adapt, makes it slightly more laborious, something that in the Unix and Linux world, is totally inadmissible, the motto is: ‚ÄúDo less and have more results!‚Äù, which boil down to the scripts that create ‚ÄúBots‚Äù that do everything for us! üòÑ</p>

<p>Come on the list then!</p>

<h2 id="13th---sash">13th - <a href="http://members.tip.net.au/~dbell/">Sash</a></h2>
<p>Better known as ** Stand-alone Shell ** (meaning its acronym), it is a Unix shell designed for use in recovering certain types of system crashes.</p>

<p>The internal sash commands have all libraries statically linked; therefore, unlike most shells on Linux, standard UNIX commands do not depend on external libraries.</p>

<p>For example, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">copy</code> (cp) command requires <code class="highlighter-rouge">libc.so</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ld-linux.so</code> when created from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ coreutils /">GNU Core Utilities on Linux</a>. If any of these libraries become corrupted, the coreutils <code class="highlighter-rouge">cp</code> command will not work; however, in <code class="highlighter-rouge">sash</code>, the internal command <code class="highlighter-rouge">cp</code> would not be affected.</p>

<p>Its official page is: <a href="http://members.tip.net.au/~dbell/">http://members.tip.net.au/~dbell/</a>. And it is available in the repositories of most Linux and BSD distributions. Then you can use the package manager to install it. Gentoo Example:</p>

<h2 id="12th---mksh">12th - <a href="https://www.mirbsd.org/mksh.htm">Mksh</a></h2>
<p>mksh is MirBSD Korn Shell, an actively developed free implementation of the Korn Shell programming language and successor to <a href="https://ecsoft2.org/pdksh-public-domain-korn-shell">Public Domain Korn Shell (pdksh)</a>. It is developed as part of the [MirOS] Project (https://www.mirbsd.org) as a native Bourne/POSIX/Korn shell for MirOS BSD, but also to be readily available on other UNIX-like operating systems. It is intended for users who want a compact, fast, reliable and secure shell without cutting out modern extensions with unicode support.</p>

<p>Due to its speed, POSIX compliance and advanced features, it is ideal for scripting. But it can also serve very well as a login shell. It is used as default shell on Android.</p>

<p>Its official page is: <a href="https://www.mirbsd.org/mksh.htm">https://www.mirbsd.org/mksh.htm</a>. And it is available in the repositories of most Linux and BSD distributions. Then you can use the package manager to install it. Gentoo Example:</p>

<h2 id="11th---power-shell">11th - <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">Power Shell</a></h2>
<p>PowerShell (including Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core) is a Microsoft framework for task automation and configuration management, consisting of a command line shell and associated scripting language built into the .NET framework.</p>

<p>PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI, allowing administrators to perform administrative tasks on remote and local Windows systems, as well as WS-Management and CIM that enables management of remote Linux systems and network devices. Initially a Windows-only component, PowerShell became open source and multiplatform on August 18, 2016.</p>

<p>Its official page is: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/</a>. Unlike the previous ones mentioned here, it is not available in the repositories of Linux and BSD distributions, but it is possible to use maneuvers such as: Compile, use third party repositories (like PPA in Ubuntu) and others.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://gpo.zugaina.org/dev-lang/powershell-bin">Gentoo</a> you can install via Layman, example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">sudo </span>layman <span class="nt">-a</span> pentoo

<h2 id="10th---ion-shell">10th - <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/ion">Ion Shell</a></h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/shell/ionshell.png" alt="Ion Shell" /></p>

<p>Ion is a modern system shell that features simple yet powerful syntax. It is written entirely in Rust, which greatly enhances the quality and overall safety of the shell. It also offers a performance level that exceeds that of <a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/ash/">Dash/Ash</a> by taking advantage of Ion‚Äôs capabilities. Although developed alongside and primarily for RedoxOS, it is fully capable on other nix platforms.</p>

<p>Its official page is: <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/ion">https://github.com/redox-os/ion</a>. It is also not available in the Linux and BSD distributions repositories, but it is possible to use maneuvers such as: Compile, use third party repositories (like PPA in Ubuntu) and others.</p>

<p>For example, on Ubuntu you can add a PPA:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/shell/tcsh.png" alt="Tcsh" /></p>

<p>It is a Unix shell based on and compatible with the C (csh) shell. It is essentially the C shell with programmable command line completion, command line editing, and some other features. Unlike other common shells, functions cannot be defined in a tcsh script and the user must use aliases (as in csh). It is the native root shell for BSD-based systems such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hftefBW0bmM">FreeBSD</a>.</p>

<p>The ‚Äút‚Äù in tcsh comes from the ‚ÄúT‚Äù in TENEX, an operating system that inspired Ken Greer at tegsh author Carnegie Mellon University with its command completion feature. Its syntax has a parenthesized <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> similar to several other programming languages, for example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="s2">input"</span> <span class="o">=</span> ~ <span class="o">[</span>0-9] <span class="k">*</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="k">then

<h2 id="3rd---ksh">3rd - <a href="http://www.kornshell.com/">Ksh</a></h2>
<p>Considered to be the most popular Shell on Unix systems, Korn Shell was developed by David Korn of Bell Labs, and is a superset of sh, ie it has all the features of sh and has added many more. Full compatibility with sh has brought many Shell users and programmers into this environment. In short, KSH - korn Shell was the first Shell to introduce advanced features.</p>

<h2 id="2nd---csh">2nd - <a href="http://bxr.su/NetBSD/bin/csh/">Csh</a></h2>
<p>The Csh or C shell was developed by Bill Joy of the University of Berkeley and is the most commonly used shell in BSD and Xenix environments. Originally derived from the sixth edition of Unix/bin/sh (which was the Thompson shell), Bourne shell‚Äôs predecessor.</p>

<p>The syntax was modeled after the C programming language. Csh has added many apparatuses on top of the Bourne shell, such as aliases and command history. Today, the original csh is not widely used on Unix; has been outperformed by other shells such as Tenex C shell (tcsh) originally based on C shell code, adding file name complementing and command line editing compared to Korn shell (ksh), and GNU Bourne-Again shell (bash). An independently developed and modern C shell created by Nicole Hamilton also survives on Windows in the form of the Hamilton C shell.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you are interested in switching from Shell, you can use the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">chsh</code> (<strong>CH</strong> ange <strong>SH</strong> ell) for this, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Changing to <em>mksh</em> you can pass the path or name only if you wish. To find the path, use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">which</code> command, for example to find the path of mksh itself: <code class="highlighter-rouge">which mksh</code></p>
</blockquote>
