<p>Computer networks facilitate the sharing of information and resources between several interconnected nodes (network points). It is considered the backbone of telecommunications in the field of technology.</p>

<p>The other crucial term in networking is computer network security. It refers to the set of rules and configurations adopted to prevent and monitor the improper use of the network, data modification (integrity) and denial of access and resources to the network.</p>

<p>Having understood these two terms, we can now examine network scanning. Network scanning is mainly about security on computer networks. It is a procedure used to identify nodes in a network, services offered by different devices, identify network security systems in place, operating systems, protect networks from attacks and check the overall health of the network.</p>

<p>In this post, we handpicked the six best network scanners for Linux systems. When choosing a network scanning tool, a network administrator must understand the scanning features of a specific utility and the functional areas it covers.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Each network has its weaknesses in terms of bugs, loopholes and even incorrect settings. All of this can lead an attacker to exploit the vulnerabilities. Network monitoring is therefore a critical activity that every network administrator must perform from time to time to avoid intrusion. Network scanning tools make this task much more comfortable and straightforward.</p>

<p>As an administrator, you will need to make a difficult decision about which tool is best for your network. I suggest you go for a utility that provides advanced exploit detections, comprehensive port scanning and web vulnerability assessments.</p>

<p>In this article, we saw some of the best Linux network scanning tools and, fortunately, most of them are freeware. Go through each one and choose the most suitable for your network.</p>
