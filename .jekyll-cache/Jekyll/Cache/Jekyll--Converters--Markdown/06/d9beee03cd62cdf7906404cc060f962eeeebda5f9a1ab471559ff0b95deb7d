<p>Everyone knows that <a href="https://is.gd/KdxXkD">ZOOM</a> has been reported a lot lately for having serious security flaws and several people have avoided it and companies like Google, for example, have banned the use of it.</p>

<p>Some people have never heard of ZOOM, and others don’t even know what it’s for. But he was curious to know what alternatives to this software.</p>

<p>And today we are going to know the best alternative to ZOOM, which is not only <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source</a>, but also <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.pt-br.html">Free Software</a>, that is, it is licensed so that there is no type of data collection or malware in the code or in its binary.</p>

<p>I’m referring to <a href="https://jami.net/">Jami</a>.</p>

<p>Jami uses TLS 1.3 with a perfect forwarding secrecy requirement for negotiated ciphers for calls and file transfers. The messages are encrypted with an RSA key.</p>

<h1 id="and-how-to-install-jami">And how to install Jami?</h1>

<p>As already mentioned, the same is available for Linux, macOS and Windows, in addition to mobile device systems: iOS and Android, among other devices and platforms.</p>

<p>On Linux, they made a point of making installation easier and making packages available for the most popular distributions. See the image below:</p>
