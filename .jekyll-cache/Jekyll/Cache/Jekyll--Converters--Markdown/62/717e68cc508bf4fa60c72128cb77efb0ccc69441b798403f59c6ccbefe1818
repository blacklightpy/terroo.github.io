<p>The dark theme plunges your desktop into depths of Hell, while the ray-traced screensaver keeps your PC looking evil even when you‚Äôre not using it.</p>

<p>The CD also contains a 30 minute EP of the best creative-commons licensed heavy metal music from the likes of StabWounD, Auvernia, Frontside, Skaut, Taste of Hell, Scape.Goat and Holy Pain.</p>

<p>SE can either be run from the CD or installed to your computer using the graphical installer. On a typical computer the installation should take you less than 25 minutes. It is built on top of Ubuntu 8.04, so check out the Ubuntu site for a full list of features.

<p>MD5 sums available here [what‚Äôs this?]</p>

<p>If you already have Ubuntu installed, you can simply add the packages by following these instructions.
Using the Live CD</p>

<p>You can run Ubuntu Satanic Edition straight off the Live CD. Please note that due to the slow speed of CDs it may take a while to boot up. Please be patient, it‚Äôs worth it! Once booted, you should have access to a fully functional PC including Firefox 3 for surfing the web. There will be an icon on the desktop entitled ‚ÄúMusic for the Damned‚Äù. Double clicking on this will display the tracks from the EP. Move the mouse over them or double-click to play.</p>

<h1 id="installing-from-the-cd">Installing from the CD</h1>

<p>Once the Live CD has booted, there will be an icon on the desktop entitled ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù. Click this to run the graphical installer. You can either overwrite what is on your disk or install alongside your current operating system.</p>

<p>Some applications have been removed from the standard Ubuntu CD to make space for our theme and music. This includes the OpenOffice productivity suite comprising of a word processor, spreadsheet and presentation software. It also includes the Evolution email client, the F-spot photo management application, the Tomboy desktop note taking the program and some games. You can easily grab this software from the Internet once SE is installed by running the following commands:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get update
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get <span class="nb">install </span>openoffice.org
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get <span class="nb">install </span>evolution

<h1 id="installing-within-windows">Installing Within Windows</h1>

<p>As well as installing on its partition, it is possible to install Ubuntu SE into a file within Windows. This allows Windows users to try it with the least impact on their system. Simply insert the CD and click ‚ÄúInstall Within Windows‚Äù on the CD menu.</p>
