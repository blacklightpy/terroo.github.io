![List with 30 browsers for Linux](/assets/img/browser/iceweasel.png)
## Iceweasel
Iceweasel is an open source Internet browser exclusively for Linux distributions based on Debian. It is identical to Mozilla Firefox, which cannot be distributed together with Debian because it has the brand and icon patented by the Mozilla Foundation, since the content distributed with Debian must be completely free. The name was proposed in opposition to the meaning of the word Firefox (literally, "fire fox", one of the names of the red panda). "Iceweasel" literally means "ice weasel".

![List with 30 browsers for Linux](/assets/img/browser/icecat.png)
## IceCat GNUzilla
GNUzilla is the GNU version of the Mozilla suite, and GNU IceCat is the GNU version of the Firefox browser. Its main advantage is an ethical issue: it is entirely free software. While the Firefox source code from the Mozilla project is free software, they distribute and recommend non-free software like plug-ins and add-ons. Your trademark license also restricts distribution in a number of ways incompatible with freedom.
