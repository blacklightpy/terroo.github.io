There are several extensions in [VSCode](https://terminalroot.com/tags#vscode) for specific situations, but there are also those that can be used in multiple situations and we can consider them as a general proposal.

In this article we will learn about 8 extensions for VSCode with a general purpose!

## 01. [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
![Prettier](/assets/img/vscode/vscode-exts/01.png)

[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) is very popular, so it won't surprise anyone that it's on the list. When using Prettier, your code is aligned and formatted. They say it works better with [JS](https://terminalroot.com/tags#javascript) and [JSON](https://terminalroot.com/tags#json).
> There are some versions for other Editors/IDEs: <https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html>

## 02. [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
![GitHub Copilot](/assets/img/vscode/vscode-exts/02.png)

[GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) is an extension that does more specifically what [ChatGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch ?v=33Z91g0xrtA&ab_channel=TerminalRoot) does! In other words, there's nothing like a *help* from an [AI](https://terminalroot.com/tags/#artificialinteligence) to help us when writing our codes.

## 03. [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server)
![Live Preview](/assets/img/vscode/vscode-exts/03.jpg)

The [Live Preview] extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) is a localhost built into your VSCode, very useful for multiple cases. It's worth having it installed too!

## 04. [GitHub Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview)
![GitHub Markdown Preview](/assets/img/vscode/vscode-exts/04.png)

And speaking of *Preview* [GitHub Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview) is also to see in advance how your Markdown looks after rendering directly on your VSCode!

## 05. [Database Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cweijan.vscode-database-client2)
![Database Client](/assets/img/vscode/vscode-exts/05.jpg)

And speaking of *embedded*, instead of using [Client SQL](https://terminalroot.com/tags#sql) externally, how about using it inside VSCode? Well, [Database Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cweijan.vscode-database-client2) is one of the most necessary extensions on this list and its use is simple and functional!

## 06. [VSCodeVim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)
![VSCodeVim](/assets/img/vscode/vscode-exts/06.jpg)

[VSCodeVim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) is the combination of the two best worlds into one! We've already made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HAFJu_O7Gk) about it: how to configure it, create mappings and among others, [it's worth watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HAFJu_O7Gk).

## 07. [VSCode Great Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons)
![VSCode Great Icons](/assets/img/vscode/vscode-exts/07.jpg)

And to close the *beautified* article, there's nothing like having icons displayed in the VSCode directory tree and in other situations. It also serves to quickly identify types of articles.
