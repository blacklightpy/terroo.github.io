The most recommended [programming language](https://terminalroot.com/hello-world-in-25-programming-languages-proposal-docs-and-links/) for creating Graphical Interfaces , better known as [GUI](https://terminalroot.com/tags#gui), is [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp), in addition to [Games Development](https://terminalroot.com/tags#games), embedded systems and among several other forms of use that can be consulted [here](https://terminalroot.com/list-of-some-famous-software-written-in-cpp/).

In this article, we are going to get to know the **7 most used and recommended C++ libraries for creating graphical interfaces**. Each one with its specification and recommendation.

# 01. [Gtkmm](https://cutt.ly/gtkmm)
![Gtkmm](/assets/img/cpp/gui/gtkmm.jpg)

[gtkmm](https://www.gtkmm.org/) (formerly known as **gtk--** or **gtk minus minus** ) is the official [C++](https://terminalroot.com) interface for the popular GUI library [GTK](https://gtk.org/) . **gtkmm** is [free software](https://terminalroot.com/tags#freesoftware) distributed under the [GNU](https://terminalroot.com/tags#gnu) Lesser [General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.en.html) (LGPL).

**gtkmm** allows the creation of user interfaces in code or with the [Glade Interface Designer](https://glade.gnome.org/) , using the [Gtk::Builder](https://developer-old.gnome.org/gtkmm/stable/classGtk_1_1Builder.html) class. Other features include type-safe callbacks, a comprehensive set of control graphics, and widget extensibility through inheritance.

We have a series about gtkmm that can be seen in the video below:

# 02. [Qt](https://qt.io/)
![Qt](/assets/img/cpp/gui/qt.jpg)

[Qt](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp) (pronounced "cute" ) is a widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms, such as [Linux](https://terminalroot.com/tags#linux) , [Windows](https://terminalroot.com/tags#windows) , [macOS](https://terminalroot.com/tags#macos) , Android or embedded systems with little or no change to the underlying code base, yet it is still a native app with native features and speed.

The [Qt](https://qt.io/) is currently being developed by **The Qt Company** , a publicly traded company, and the **Qt Project** under [Open Source](https://terminalroot.com/tags#opensource) , involving individual developers and organizations working to advance **Qt**. [Qt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF809OoXfjM) is available under commercial and open source licenses [GPL 2.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html), [GPL 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) and [LGPL 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html) licenses ) .

Some famous software written with wxwidgets:
+ [0 AD](https://play0ad.com/) - a FLOSS game similar to *Age of Empires*
+ [aMule](http://amule.org/) - Peer to Peer file sharing application
+ [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) - cross-platform sound editor
+ [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/) - Peer to Peer file sharing application
+ [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) - IDE [C](https://terminalroot.com/tags#linguagemc)/[C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp)
+ [CodeLite](https://codelite.org/) - Simple [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp) Editor (collection of free tools, implemented by plug-ins)
+ [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) - client [FTP](https://terminalroot.com/2015/01/utilizando-ftp-por-comando.html)

And among others.

# 04. [Ultimate++](https://terminalroot.com/2021/08/crie-interfaces-graficas-com-ultimatepp.html)
![Ultimate++](/assets/img/cpp/gui/ultimatepp.jpg)

[Ultimate++](http://ultimatepp.org/) , also known as **U++** or **Upp** - is a rapid application development framework [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp) which aims to reduce the code complexity of typical desktop applications by extensively exploiting the features of C++ .

# 05. [Dear ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
![Dear ImGUI](/assets/img/cpp/gui/imgui.png)

[Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) is an [immediate mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI) graphical user interface written in [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp) with back-ends for various graphical APIs (Allegro 5, DirectX, GLFW, iOS, Marmalade, Metal, OpenGL, SDL2 and Vulkan), which also has:
+ projects for additional backend support ( Android , Irrlicht Engine , OGRE , SFML , ...)
+ projects for additional language bindings ( C#/.NET, D, Go, Haskell, Java , ...)
+ ports to other languages (like Java, for example)

See a video below about Dear ImGUI and [SFML](https://terminalroot.com/tags#sfml)

# 06. [Nana](http://nanapro.org/)
![Nana](/assets/img/cpp/gui/nana.png)

**Nana** is a cross-platform library [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp)
for creating graphical user interfaces. It uses a platform-independent API and
currently supports [Windows](https://terminalroot.com/tags#windows) , [Linux](https://terminalroot.com/tags#linux) and FreeBSD .

Nana was written in [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp) and targets only that language.

The following example of Nana creates a window with a caption "[Hello, World](https://terminalroot.com/hello-world-in-25-programming-languages-proposal-docs-and-links/)" and a "Quit" button:

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <nana/gui/wvl.hpp>
#include <nana/gui/widgets/button.hpp>

int main(){
     using namespace nana;
     form fm;
     fm.caption("Hello World");
     button btn(fm, rectangle(20, 20, 150, 30));
     btn.caption("Quit");
     btn.events().click(API::exit);
     fm.show();
     exec();
}
{% endhighlight %}

[Nana](http://nanapro.org/) is free and [open source](https://terminalroot.com/tags#opensource) software, licensed under the [Boost Software License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boost_C++_libraries#License) .

# 07. [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/)
![FLTK](/assets/img/cpp/gui/fltk.jpg)

**Fast Light Toolkit** ( [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/) , pronounced fulltick ) is a cross-platform widget (graphical control element) library for graphical user interfaces ([GUIs](https://terminalroot.com/tags#gui)), developed by Bill Spitzak and others. Designed to accommodate 3D graphics programming, it has an OpenGL interface, but is also suitable for general [GUI](https://terminalroot.com/tags#gui) programming.

Using its own widget, drawing systems and events abstracted from the underlying system-dependent code, it allows you to write programs that look the same on all supported operating systems.

[FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/) is free and open source software, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) with an additional clause that allows static links from applications with incompatible licenses.
