![The 32 Best IDEs/Text Editors for C++](/assets/img/cpp/cpp-editores-min.jpg)

---

Not everyone has the same tastes and when it comes to development [C++](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/compile-for-c-cpp-with-lua-based-xmake/) the form and environment can vary from person to person.

Many are not satisfied with the development environment they use or plan to test others to see if things run better.

Based on that I decided to build the biggest list of Text Editors and IDEs for [C++](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/i-created-a-c-financial-management-program-for-linux-and-windows/) where many of these alternatives will also work for other [programming languages](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/hello-world-in-25-programming-languages-proposal-docs-and-links/), mainly for [Linguagem C](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/examples-of-functions-fread-fwrite-remove-and-others-in-c/).

So let's go to the list because it's nothing small! ðŸ˜ƒ

# 01. Neovim
![Neovim](/assets/img/cpp/editors/neovim.jpg)

[Neovim](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/all-about-neovim-with-lua-how-to-customize-from-zero/) is a fork of [Vim](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/how-to-customize-your-vim-from-zero-to-c-cpp-ubuntu-cinnamon/) with the objective of improving the code base, allowing easier API implementation, better user experience and plug-in implementation.

In addition to [C](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/examples-of-functions-fread-fwrite-remove-and-others-in-c/) and [C++](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/i-created-a-c-financial-management-program-for-linux-and-windows/) it is also suitable for any other [programming language](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/hello-world-in-25-programming-languages-proposal-docs-and-links/).

We have a complete series about **Neovim** which includes: Installation, Customization, Installation of plugins and more and you can start it from [this link](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/all-about-neovim-with-lua-how-to-customize-from-zero/) .

# 04. Emacs
![Emacs](/assets/img/cpp/editors/emacs.jpg)

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs , describes it as "the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor". Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s, and work on its direct descendant, GNU Emacs, actively continues into 2021 .

[Emacs](https://emacsporn.tumblr.com/) has more than 10,000 [commands](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/large-list-of-gnulinux-commands-by-categories/) built in and its user interface allows the user to combine these commands into macros to automate the work.

Emacs implementations usually have a dialect of the **Lisp** programming language. Extensions have been written to manage email, files, outlines, and [RSS feeds](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/feed), as well as clones of ELIZA, Pong, Conway's Life, Snake and Tetris.

Emacs is considered by many to be *an operating system* (contains irony). The most popular and most ported version of Emacs is GNU Emacs, which was created by Richard Stallman for the GNU Project.
