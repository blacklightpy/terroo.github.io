![Download more than 20,000 Games for MegaDrive, SuperNintendo, PlayStation and others](/assets/img/games/all-games.jpg)

In the [previous post](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/play-retro-games-on-linux-with-mednafen/) to this one we show how you can play games from almost all consoles : [Play Retro Games on Linux with Mednafen](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/play-retro-games-on-linux-with-mednafen/)

And now we are back with more good news!

There are over 20,000 games separated into 23GB of content. You don't necessarily need to download everything, you can right-click on the game you want and select: **Download** â†’ **Standard download**.

Also because there must be some that you don't like. But it is better than staying: waiting for those *counts* (waiting time), typing *captcha*, bla bla bla.

To access all the content just click [this link](https://bit.ly/33cW9X3)!

The content is separated by console and even has emulators, in case you need it, as in the image below!

Run because you're at *mega.nz*, the FBI decides to delete it again! ðŸ˜ƒ
