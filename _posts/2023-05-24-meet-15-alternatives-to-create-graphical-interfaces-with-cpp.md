We already made an [article](https://terminalroot.com/the-7-best-cpp-frameworks-for-creating-graphical-interfaces/) that detailed about:
## [The 7 Best C++ Frameworks to Create Graphical Interfaces](https://terminalroot.com/the-7-best-cpp-frameworks-for-creating-graphical-interfaces/)
Where there were many details including tutorial videos.

In this article we are going to know more **15 ALTERNATIVES** not so well known, but also very efficient to create **Graphic Interfaces** with [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp)

# 01. [XTD](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd)
**xtd** is a free and open source modern framework built with C++17 and C++20 for creating GUI Graphical Interfaces and unit testing applications.

It is available for: [Microsoft Windows](https://terminalroot.com/tags#windows), [Apple macOS](https://terminalroot.com/tags#macos), iOS, [Android]( https://terminalroot.com/tags#android) and also for [GNU/Linux](https://terminalroot.com/tags#gnu).

# 02. [NanoGUI](https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui)
**NanoGUI** is a minimalist cross-platform widget library for OpenGL 3.x and above. It supports automatic layout generation, callbacks with [lambdas](https://terminalroot.com/10-examples-of-using-lambda-functions-in-cpp/), a variety of useful widget types, and Retina-compatible rendering on Apple devices.

# 03. [Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear)
**Nuklear** is a minimal state, immediate mode GUI toolkit. It is designed as a simple, embeddable UI for application and has no operating system dependencies, a default rendering backend, or window/input handling.

But it does provide a highly modular library-based approach, with simple input state for input and drawing commands that describe primitive shapes as output. So instead of providing a layered library that tries to abstract multiple platforms and render backends, it just focuses on the actual UI.

# 04. [RayGUI](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui)
**RayGUI** is a simple and easy to use instant mode GUI library. It was originally inspired by Unity IMGUI (immediate mode GUI API).

raygui was designed as a helper module for [raylib](https://terminalroot.com/create-games-for-windows-linux-and-web-with-raylib-c-cpp/) to create simple GUI interfaces using the raylib graphical style (simple colors, simple rectangular shapes, wide borders...), but can be adapted to other engines/frameworks.

# 10. [LibUI](https://github.com/andlabs/libui)
**libui** is currently mid-alpha software. Much of what is currently present works stably enough for the examples and maybe a few small programs to work, but stability is still a work in progress, much of what already exists is not complete, some of it will have bugs on certain platforms, and many things are missing.
