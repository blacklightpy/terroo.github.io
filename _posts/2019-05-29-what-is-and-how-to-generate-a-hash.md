A **cryptographic** scatter function or cryptographic hash function is a hash function considered almost impossible *to reverse*, that is, to recreate the input value using only the scatter value. These unidirectional hash functions have been called "*the workers of modern cryptography*".

The input data is usually called message, and the message scatter value summarized or *simply summary*.

The hashes are also called:

+ hash function, or:
+ checksums;
+ hash codes;
+ and among other nomenclatures.

Broadly speaking:

A hash is a sequence of bits generated by an algorithm, generally represented in **hexadecimal** base, that allows the visualization in letters and numbers (*0 to 9 and A to F*). Or simply: "hash is the transformation of a large amount of data into a small amount of information".

There are types of hashes (or hash functions), they can be: md5, sha256, whirpool and among others less used. For more information watch the video below and see the links at the end of this post.
