One of the things that linusers enjoy most is to customize their environment in their own way. Among resources, tools and possibilities, one of the resources that most stiffen the environment are the Conkys which are widgets that are highlighted on your desktop displaying some information from your system and have various styles. And I have separated 15 models for you.

# 14. [Equalizer Conky](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1112402/)

Instead, it will display common system status parameters with a few vertical bars that look exactly like an equalizer view.
