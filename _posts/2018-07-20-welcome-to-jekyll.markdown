# Welcome all to my personal blog: Marcos Oliveira!

First blog post <https://terroo.github.io> . This blog will support Gentoo n00bs and pro users, that is, it will have basic and advanced tips. For you that have some difficulty configuring the [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org/) system, espero que seja útil. I hope it is useful. The blog has a very suggestive url subdomain name: [Terroo](https://terroo.github.io) that is the junction of [Terminal Root](http://terminalroot.com.br/) (my professional site, founded in 2011) with [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org/) , thus giving a conjuncture that maybe, later, it will be a project to build a [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux). I also have a [usuário](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Marcos.oliveira) on the [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org/) [Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Main_Page), to contribute documentation and translation.

I hope you like this blog!

Above a basic example of an [ebuild](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Basic_guide_to_write_Gentoo_Ebuilds), things like that you'll also find a lot here, as well as repositories for [Layman](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Layman) .

> __Note__: Note that here in [GitHub](https://github.com) you can also download as [tar.gz](http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/) and not only in [zip](https://support.pkware.com/display/PKZIP/APPNOTE) as there is the alternative in the projects? A detail that will also serve as an example of things you will see here. Below is a brief list of useful links.
