![The 17 Best Themes for your Openbox](/assets/img/openbox/pelangi-min.jpg)

In addition to being minimalist and lightweight, **Openbox** is also surprisingly customizable and flexible. A user can easily change various settings related to theme, appearance, window placement, snapping and more.

For those who want to escape the "*weight*" of a [Desktop Environment](https://terminalroot.com.br/tags#gnome), however, having a simple environment with facilities to close, expand and minimize windows is not there is still nothing better than Openbox.

In this article, we will know 17 themes carefully selected by me from this excellent [windows manager](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/wayfire-a-wm-3d-composer-installation-on-arch-linux/) .

# 01. Afterpiece
This is perhaps the simplest on this list, ideal for those who like minimalism, but with the *dark side of strength*!

# How to install themes?
I've separated them all into a single repository to make it easier, so you can do it like this:
> In the repository there is only [Cosmic-Travel](https://github.com/Alexdaz/Cosmic-Travel)

{% highlight sh %}
mkdir -p ~/.themes
git clone https://github.com/terroo/openbox-themes
cd openbox-themes
mv * ~/.themes
{% endhighlight %}

And to change the theme there are two ways. The first is how do I edit the file: `~/.config/openbox/rc.xml`

and Below the `<theme>` tag between the `<name>` tags inform the name of the theme according to its folder name, example:
> Use the same name as there is in this article in the title of each one, respecting the dashes(`-`) and the underlines(`_`), without spaces.

{% highlight html %}
<theme>
  <name>Surreal_Gentoo</name>
<!-- ... -->
{% endhighlight %}

And then reread the Openbox settings:

{% highlight sh %}
openbox --reconfigure
{% endhighlight %}

The other one is even simpler, just install **LX Appearance** and use it is a graphical and intuitive program.
