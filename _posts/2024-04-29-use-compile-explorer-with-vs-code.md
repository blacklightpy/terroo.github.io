[Compile Explorer](https://compiler-explorer.com/) is an online tool that allows developers write code in various programming languages, mainly [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp), and see how this code is translated into machine instructions by compilers.

It shows the code [Assembly](https://terminalroot.com/how-to-run-assembly-within-cpp-code/) generated for different platforms and optimizations, helping developers understand improve the internal functioning of compilers and optimizers.

This tool is useful for experimenting and comparing different pieces of code and for learning about the compilation process.

Another good news is that you can use it **within [VS CODE](https://terminalroot.com/tags#vscode)** using it as an extension!
