![Top 12 Launchers for Linux](/assets/img/launchers/04-albert.jpg)

A **Launcher** is an application launcher that helps a user locate and launch other computer programs. An application launcher provides shortcuts to computer programs and stores shortcuts in one place for easy locating.

In the comparison of the following desktop application launchers, each section is devoted to a desktop environment for Linux, although there are versions of some for other systems.

### 5. [Gnome Do](https://launchpad.net/do)

### 6. [Rofi](https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi/)

<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

Rofi started out as a clone of simpleswitcher, written by Sean Pringle, a pop-up switcher based primarily on superswitcher.

Simpleswitcher laid the groundwork and therefore Sean Pringle deserves most of the credit for this tool. Rofi, renamed for losing its simple property, has been extended with extra features such as a run dialog, an ssh launcher and can act as a replacement for the menu menu making it a very versatile tool.

Rofi, like dmenu, will provide the user with a textual list of options from which one or more can be selected. It can be by running an application by selecting a window or options provided by an external script.

</script>

Gnome-Pie is a circular application launcher for Linux. It is made of several pies, each made up of several slices.

<!-- LISTA MIN -->
<script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"

data-ad-slot="5351066970"></ins>
<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

The user presses a keystroke that opens the desired pie. By activating one of its slices, applications can be started, keys pressed can be simulated, or files can be opened.

The user does not need to remember the name of an application - only the direction should be remembered.

### 11. [Kupfer](https://kupferlauncher.github.io/)

<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

Kupfer is a command tool highly inspired by *Small Quicksilver iconQuicksilver*; You don't use it to search your files, but to invoke an application or document quickly by entering the first parts of its name.

Kupfer is written using [Python](https://terminalroot.com.br/2019/12/as-30-better-libraries-e-packages-python-para-beginners.html) and has a flexible architecture. Objects that it can access are implemented in plugins and new plugins can be written quickly. Kupfer's philosophy is simplicity.

Implementation is simple, makes easy things work first, and doesn't design too many unnecessary parts of the program. When you run kupfer, it starts and at any time you type Kupfers keybinding - immediately your window is presented ready for a new query.

### 12. [Application Finder](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-appfinder/start)

![Application Finder](/assets/img/launchers/12-application-finder.jpg)

Application Finder is a program for finding and launching applications installed on your system and executing commands quickly.

You can use App Finder to quickly add launchers to your dashboard - just drag an item to the desired dashboard and it will automatically create a launcher for that app.

The application finder has two modes:

- Collapse mode: where you can search for commands directly and execute them when Enter is pressed.

- Expanded mode: where you can search the applications installed on your system and view command history.

To switch between modes, click the Up or Down arrow keys when the entry is in focus, or click the arrow on the right edge of the entry.
