This day I was testing some things in Git and thought of visualizing some things graphically locally (because for GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket and others is also possible) and started researching some graphics client for this. And I separated the 5 that I considered best (not all I tested), but I chose only 1.
Introduction

Git provides a wealth of untapped information. We believe that with this information you will be able to make the best choice today!

So I made a ranking, the # 1, of course, was what I chose, but you may have a different taste, let's go to the ranking!

Gitg is the GNOME GUI client for viewing git repositories. It is available for Linux and Windows only. On your Linux, use the package manager to install it, for example:

![Top 5 Best Git Clients for Linux, Mac and Windows](/assets/img/git/gitahead.png)

The Linux version provides a .sh file that is an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) and you can run it without having to install it, however, when you run it, it asks if you want to extract the files in the directory where you ran it and automatically creates a `.desktop` on your `~/.config` linked to the extracted files, so you can find it with the icon in your Dash.

And you can also choose the Light or Dark theme as soon as it opens for the first time.
Conclusion

I chose GitAhead because I found the interface simpler and more interesting. Of course there are other alternatives that are also very cool, such as [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), but I made sure to choose the best ones that covered the 3 platforms (Linux, macOS and Windows) with as few exceptions as possible, and that Linux was on all, which This is not the case with SourceTree. I hope you enjoyed and managed to decide the best in your opinion. And tell us in the comments which one you like best according to this article. Hugs!
