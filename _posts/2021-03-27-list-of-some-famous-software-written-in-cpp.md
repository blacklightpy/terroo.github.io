![List of some famous software written in C++](/assets/img/cpp/cpp.jpg)

I once read someone saying, "[C++](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/i-created-a-c-financial-management-program-for-linux-and-windows/) not my favorite programming language, but my religion!" ðŸ˜ƒ, I make this quote my words!

Some people think that [C++](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/drogon-cpp-the-fastest-web-framework-in-the-world/) is just a classy C, but in fact [C++](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/learn-to-create-a-graphical-application-with-c-and-gtkmm/) has both C concepts and the Simula programming language. These in turn were also based on others. C was based on the B programming language (which in turn was a BCPL miniset), and [Simula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula) was based on [ALGOL 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60).

Some people consider it a difficult syntax language, the creator of Pascal once said that [C++](https://en.terminalroot.com.br/conan-a-package-manager-for-cc/) was an [insult to the human brain](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=776861016595069&set=gm.10158466298289102), precisely because of the complexity of C++.

But not quite! If it were that difficult, it would not be widely chosen by several mega projects that test everything before: performance, safety, ... to choose the ideal language, about this we can currently quote [Ingenuity](https://terminalroot.com.br/2021/02/repositorio-e-detalhes-do-software-escrito-em-cpp-do-drone-da-nasa-em-marte.html) the drone that will fly on the planet Mars, which by the way [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) reported that the possible date will be April 8, 2021.

Despite citing Ingenuity, the list of software is very long, so I separated some more well-known by category, let's go know what they are!

# Operational systems
Most operating systems are written in C and C++ languages. These include:
+ Windows 95, 98, 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and 10;
+ Apple Mac OS X;
+ Symbian OS;
+ Be-OS;
+ Google Chrome OS;
+ RIM BlackBerry OS 4.x;
+ Apple iPhone iPod Touch and iPad OS;
+ and Haiku OS, which is 100% written in C++ only.
Linux, although there are parts written in C++, mostly C only prevails.

# Web browsers
+ Google Chrome (and its foks, like Chromium, Edge, for example)
+ Mozilla Firefox
+ Safari
+ Opera

# Office Products
+ Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, Outlook, FrontPage)
+ LibreOffice
+ Apache OpenOffice
+ Corel Office / WordPerfect Office

# Email Clients
+ Microsoft Outlook
+ IBM Lotus Notes
+ Mozilla Thunderbird

# Web Sites
+ Facebook - Although your display code is PHP, C++ is the one who executes all requests.
+ Youtube - Like Facebook, Youtube uses Python as a "front-end" that delivers to C++ to process all requests.
+ Amazon - In many of its services
+ Paypal - All backend

# Multimedia Players
+ Microsoft Windows Media Player
+ Apple iPod software
+ VLC media player

# Database systems
+ Oracle database
+ MySQL/MariaDB
+ IBM DB2
+ Microsoft SQL Server
+ IBM Informix
+ SAP DB/MaxDB
+ MongoDB

# Graphical Interfaces
+ Microsoft Windows UI
+ Apple MacOS UI (Aqua)
+ KDE (Qt)
+ GNOME

# Compilers and virtual machines for programming languages
+ Microsoft Visual C++ compiler
+ Microsoft Visual Basic Compiler
+ Microsoft Visual C # Compiler
+ Microsoft .Net CLR
+ Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

# Games
It is difficult to quote Games written in C++, because almost all of them were written in C++, it would be easier to quote those that were not written in C++, but let's try:
+ GTA
+ Doom III
+ Counter-Strike
+ Sierra Online: Birthright
+ Hell fire
+ Bullrider I and II
+ Trophy Bear
+ Kings Quest
+ Antara
+ Hoyle
+ SWAT
+ Blizzard: StarCraft
+ StarCraft: Brood War
+ Diablo I and II
+ Warcraft III, World of Warcraft

# Games Engines
Well, as I said about the Games, I use the same words to talk about Engines, almost all of them were C++, with rare exceptions, so I will summarize by mentioning only the most famous ones:
+ Unreal Engine
+ Unity
+ Godot
+ OGRE

# Multimedia editing applications
+ Adobe Photoshop
+ Adobe Illustrator
+ Blender
+ OBS Studio
+ Acrobat Reader
+ InDesign
+ GoLive

# Others
+ JavaScript
+ Node.js
+ NMAP
+ TensorFlow
+ Curiosity landing system
+ Ingenuity software
+ Microsoft Visual Studio
+ DirectX

# Some famous companies that make excessive use of C++
+ Google
+ HP
+ IBM
+ Intel
+ Microsoft

This is not the end of the list, many other powerful software are developed in C++. Many features created by C++ have been implemented in C. If any "hater friend" tries to convince you otherwise, show him that article.
