I selected 5 of different ways to use and download for free, both for game studies and to use in your commercial game or not.

Ideally, use these **tilesets** directly in your *array/array/vector* or in your preferred *level editor*.

Let's get to know and get these 5 in this article!

# 1. Tails Adventure

Let's start with the most basic of all. This tileset will serve for those who want to learn how to implement the tileset in their game. The ideal is to use a layer 50 tiles wide and 27 tiles high in the level editor.

It's a skin for the [Tails Adventure](/assets/img/gamedevttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tails_Adventure) game by [Sonic the Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog) .

# 2. Green Zone

In this tileset there is double background for background animation and the blocks are 32x32, good for a 2D RPG platform game that combines trees and buildings.
