![The 6 Best Network Scanners for Linux](/assets/img/network/computer-network-scanner.jpe)

Computer networks facilitate the sharing of information and resources between several interconnected nodes (network points). It is considered the backbone of telecommunications in the field of technology.

The other crucial term in networking is computer network security. It refers to the set of rules and configurations adopted to prevent and monitor the improper use of the network, data modification (integrity) and denial of access and resources to the network.

Having understood these two terms, we can now examine network scanning. Network scanning is mainly about security on computer networks. It is a procedure used to identify nodes in a network, services offered by different devices, identify network security systems in place, operating systems, protect networks from attacks and check the overall health of the network.

In this post, we handpicked the six best network scanners for Linux systems. When choosing a network scanning tool, a network administrator must understand the scanning features of a specific utility and the functional areas it covers.

# 3. OpenVAS
![OpenVAS](/assets/img/network/OpenVAS.jpg)

OpenVAS is a free and open source network security scanning utility distributed under the General Public License (GPL). Considered a vulnerability assessment tool, OpenVAS scans a network for connected servers, firewalls, while listening for any configuration errors in services running on those devices.

It has an exclusive feature that allows the evaluation of solutions and reveals false negatives and false positives. For any false positives, OpenVAS provides a report on why a specific vulnerability has been flagged.

</script>

The tool supports three types of scans. They include Full Scan, Web Server Scan and WordPress Scan.

A full scan tests the network and all connected devices, such as servers and web applications, for vulnerabilities. A web server scan is used to test networks for any web servers and web application vulnerabilities. The WordPress scan, as the name suggests, scans a system for vulnerabilities in WordPress and the web server.

Main features

+ OpenVAS is an excellent solution management vulnerability scanning utility.
+ Provision of reports for risk assessment and mitigation.
+ Support for smart custom scans.

# 4. Angry IP scanner
![Angry IP scanner](/assets/img/network/Angry-IP-Scanner.png)

Angry IP scanner is a free, open source network scanning tool used to scan IP addresses and ports. Each scan provides information about nodes on the network, such as host names, MAC addresses, NetBIOS information, frequently used IP ranges, presence of web servers, etc.

To speed up the network scanning process, Angry IP Scanner implements a multithreaded approach with each thread scanning a different range of IP addresses. You can save the results in several file formats, such as CSV, TXT and XML.

Main features

+ It supports scanning of ports and fast IP addresses.
+ Implements multithreaded scanning.
+ Support for various file formats - CSV, TXT and XML.

# Conclusion

Each network has its weaknesses in terms of bugs, loopholes and even incorrect settings. All of this can lead an attacker to exploit the vulnerabilities. Network monitoring is therefore a critical activity that every network administrator must perform from time to time to avoid intrusion. Network scanning tools make this task much more comfortable and straightforward.

As an administrator, you will need to make a difficult decision about which tool is best for your network. I suggest you go for a utility that provides advanced exploit detections, comprehensive port scanning and web vulnerability assessments.

In this article, we saw some of the best Linux network scanning tools and, fortunately, most of them are freeware. Go through each one and choose the most suitable for your network.
