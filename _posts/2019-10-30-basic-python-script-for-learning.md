![Basic Python Script for Learning](/assets/img/python/python3.jpg)

This script works on **python3**, but to work with **python2**, in short, the lines that contain this content must be changed:

+ **Python2** â†’ `print "String"`, **Python3** â†’ `print("String")`
+ **Python2** â†’ `raw_input`, **Python3** â†’ `input`

For those who are starting in **Python**. It is not necessary to take a course from the start, but to analyze the Python syntax, such as:
+ variables
+ loops
+ functions
+ inputs

And among other basic things, but you can do a lot of things in mind. See the script below.
> To run save with the name you want, for example: `vim starting-at-python.py`, enter the code below and run:

{% highlight bash %}
python starting-at-python.py
{% endhighlight %}

Or give execute permission and run directly:

{% highlight bash%}
chmod +x starting-in-python.py
./starting-in-python.py
{% endhighlight%}
