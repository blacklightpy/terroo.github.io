# Analyze
This information was taken from the script repository. I didn't particularly test it and I don't intend to, I feel good about [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), but as some people ask me for this tip, I decided to post it. But remember to contribute to the project by reporting [issues](https://github.com/Gictorbit/photoshopCClinux/issues) or even improving the code.
